        "\n",
        "1. __str__ Method:\n",
        "\n",
        "* The __str__ method returns a readable and user-friendly string representation of the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "* It is automatically called when an object is passed to the print() function or the str() function.\n",

        "* It is used mainly for developers and is called when using the repr() function or when the object is typed in the interpreter.\n",
